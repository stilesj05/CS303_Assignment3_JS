The screenshot includes all of the testing I have ran on the Queue, Linear Search function, and the Insertion Sort function. 

I have implemented a bunch of comments explaining what each part of the code is doing in the CS303_Assignment3.cpp.

Feel free to clone this repository and mess around with different inputs
for the functions.
